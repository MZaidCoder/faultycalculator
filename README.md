Faulty Calculator (But Sometimes Correct!)
This repository holds the code for a JavaScript calculator with a twist! It injects unexpected results for basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) most of the time. However, there's a glimmer of hope - you have a 50% chance of actually getting the correct answer!

Features:

Performs basic arithmetic operations.
Injects faulty logic for a fun and unpredictable user experience.
New! There's a 50% chance of getting the correct result (it might surprise you!).
How to Use:

Clone or download this repository.
Open the index.html file in your web browser.
Enter two numbers in the provided fields.
Select the desired operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) from the dropdown menu.
Click the "Calculate" button.
Brace yourself for the (possibly) wrong answer!
Note: Division by zero might result in an error message due to the faulty logic.

Security:

This code prioritizes security by avoiding eval(). It relies on built-in JavaScript features for calculations.

Challenge:

Feeling adventurous? Can you modify the code to introduce different types of errors or change the chance of getting a correct result?

Feel free to:

Fork this project and play around with the code!
Contribute improvements or additional features.
Let the calculated chaos begin!
